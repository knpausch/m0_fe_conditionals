# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? Pretty good. I understand && and ||
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? Good. I like making a logic tree on paper or coding it and following it to make sure it makes sense.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I love if, else if and else statements. It feels easy to follow.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? Took me about 8 hours to finish all lessons, practice, assignments, recording, and coding. I did not expect homework/lessons to that that long.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I'm interested in decimal numbers and utilizing math with our comparison operators.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? How do you write in ruby (I'm referencing challenge #3 in coding challenge). I was unable to figure it out and went down a deep rabbit hole of ruby coding videos and got more confused. I'll bring it up in class, I'm sure they're going to cover it.
